System Development Technology taught by Dr Haza Nuzly was my very first exposure to web development. Through this assignment, I was tasked with executing various scripts from W3Schools, which covered a wide range of web development topics. These scripts encompassed different aspects of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP.

### Programming Language Used

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Bootstrap 5
  - PHP

Upon completing these scripts, I gained practical knowledge in key web development technologies, from the front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap) to the back-end (PHP). This exposure not only expanded my technical skillset but also deepened my understanding of how different technologies work together to create functional and visually appealing websites.

For the submission of my homework, I was required to create a complete assignment folder on my local development environment (localhost) where I could test and showcase the scripts. Additionally, I had to host the individual assignment online and provide the URL, which I was to include in a text file. This aspect of the assignment provided a hands-on experience of deploying a web project to the internet, reinforcing the importance of hosting and sharing web applications in the real world.

Overall, this homework assignment has been an invaluable first step into the exciting world of web development, providing me with a solid foundation in multiple technologies and the skills needed to create functional and visually appealing web applications.
